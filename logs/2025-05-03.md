### 🎯 Goal
Install a working operating system (preferably Ubuntu 24.04.2) on Raspberry Pi 5 using a Samsung EVO 128GB microSD card, and resolve persistent HDMI boot issues observed during previous attempts.

## 🔁 Summary of the Day
Despite numerous flashing attempts using both Raspberry Pi Imager and Etcher, the Pi failed to boot Ubuntu 24.04.2. The root cause is strongly suspected to be hidden bad sectors on the SD card. Even though Windows could read the card, Pi's bootloader failed to read kernel files consistently. Eventually, flashing Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit) onto a **new SD card** allowed the Pi to boot successfully, though HDMI output was still missing due to display configuration or monitor compatibility issues.

## 🔨 Installation Attempts

### A. Failed Ubuntu 24.04.2 Setup (Samsung EVO 128GB)
- Tried multiple flashes using:
  - Raspberry Pi Imager v1.9.3
  - Balena Etcher (writer error occurred)
- Used `Ubuntu Desktop 24.04.2 (64-bit preinstalled for Pi)`
- ACT LED blinked 7 times repeatedly → `kernel.img not found`
- No HDMI output
- Pi fell back to EEPROM recovery screen and shut down
- `/boot` showed missing or corrupted system files (e.g., no `userconf.txt`)

<!-- Ubuntu 이미지가 SD카드에 올라가긴 했으나 Pi에서는 부팅 실패 -->

### B. Troubleshooting Efforts
- Used SD Card Formatter for full overwrite
- Repartitioned card manually (GParted)
- Switched to Raspberry Pi OS as a control test
- Modified `config.txt` with HDMI force settings:
  ```
  hdmi_force_hotplug=1
  hdmi_group=2
  hdmi_mode=82
  hdmi_drive=2
  ```
- Still experienced black screen after boot
- Verified HDMI0 usage (closer to USB-C)
- Used multiple monitors, HDMI cables, and ports
- Power button long press triggered LED color change → OS had booted

## 🧪 Findings & Observations

### SD Card Issues
- Samsung EVO 128GB read fine on PC but failed in Pi
- Windows access didn’t touch affected blocks
- Pi bootloader required 100% readable flash layout
- Formatting didn’t fix physical damage (bad sectors persist)

### HDMI Behavior
- EEPROM screen visible → HDMI working at bootloader level
- OS booted, but HDMI output cut off
- Power button GPIO interrupt proved kernel was running
- Config.txt edits ineffective → monitor likely rejecting signal or mode

> 🔍 Conclusion: OS is alive, HDMI output is the only failing link

---

## ❌ Final Outcome
- Samsung EVO 128GB is not suitable for OS boot usage
- HDMI output still broken even after successful OS boot
- OS confirmed running via GPIO behavior
- Further debugging postponed until HDMI capture device is available

---

## ✅ Next Steps

### Hardware:
- Replace SD card with:
  - **SanDisk High Endurance 32GB A1 (U1)**
  - Or: **Samsung PRO Endurance / SanDisk Ultra A1 32GB**

### Software:
- Use Raspberry Pi Imager only (not Etcher)
- First flash **Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit)** to validate system
- Then retry Ubuntu Desktop/Server 24.04.2 if stable
- Acquire **HDMI capture card** to diagnose headless HDMI output

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- PC-readable SD ≠ Pi-bootable SD — bad blocks may be invisible to Windows
- Even one bad sector can kill Ubuntu boot
- EEPROM HDMI ≠ OS HDMI — they behave differently
- A1/A2-rated SD cards essential for embedded work
- HDMI capture hardware is invaluable for headless debug
