## 🗓️ May 2, 2025 – Daily Log

### 🎯 Goal  
Install Ubuntu 24.04 on both my **laptop (control tower)** and **Raspberry Pi 5 (vehicle)**  
and verify mutual communication (e.g., SSH or VNC), since Ubuntu 22.04 is **not supported on Pi 5**.

<!-- 오늘의 목표: 라즈베리파이5에는 22.04가 안 되기 때문에, 24.04를 노트북과 Pi 모두에 설치하고 서로 연결 테스트까지 해보는 것 -->

## 🔨 Installation Attempts

### 1. Ubuntu 24.04 for laptop

- 💻 Upgraded my **laptop from Ubuntu 22.04 → 24.04**
  - Successfully performed full release upgrade
  - Removed ROS 2 Humble, planned for Iron → Jazzy

---

### 2. Ubuntu 24.04 Server (64-bit)

- ✅ **What I Tried**:
  - Used **Raspberry Pi Imager v1.9.3**
  - OS: `Ubuntu Server 24.04.2 LTS (64-bit)`
  - Customizations:
    - Hostname (`raspi5-1.local`)
    - Username/password (`lwj` / `123456789`)
    - Wi-Fi: `LWJ / 123456789`
    - SSH enabled  

- ❌ **Problems**:
  - No HDMI display
  - Green LED blinking irregularly → possible boot error
  - SSH refused connection
  - `/boot` lacked `userconf.txt`, `network-config`, `ssh`

- 💡 **Troubleshooting Notes**:
  - Server version has no GUI (expected)
  - Possibly failed OS customization
  - SD card may not have flashed properly
  - Dealing with so many boot errors really drained me.

---

### 3. Ubuntu 24.04 Desktop (64-bit)

- ✅ **What I Tried**:
  - Switched to `Ubuntu Desktop 24.04.2 LTS`
  - Re-applied same customization

- ❌ **Problems**:
  - Headless boot attempted multiple times without success
  - `/boot` contained `user-data`, `meta-data`, but GUI setup was blocked
  - No HDMI monitor available → couldn't complete first-time configuration

---

## ⚠️ Issues & Observations

- SD card sometimes not detected in Raspberry Pi Imager  
  ➤ Resolved using GParted to unmount or clear partitions

- RPi wouldn't connect to PC's Wi-Fi hotspot  
  ➤ But **connected successfully to smartphone hotspot**

- LED blink patterns useful for diagnosing boot status  
  ➤ E.g., consistent fast blinking = trying to boot, then stalls

- Safe shutdown is hard on Ubuntu Server  
  ➤ No GUI means force shutdown may be unavoidable

---


### ❌ Final Outcome

- 🟥 Raspberry Pi could not fully boot or complete first login without HDMI
- 🟥 No SSH/VNC access possible due to missing user initialization
- ✅ Laptop upgrade + ROS preparation was successful

> ❗ **Ultimately, the setup had to be paused due to the lack of an HDMI cable.**
> Will retry later using a monitor or by preparing a Pi OS image with auto-login enabled.

<!-- HDMI 선이 없어서 GUI 진입 실패 → SSH/VNC 접속도 불가능했고 결국 설치 포기 -->

---
## ✅ Next Steps

- Finish ROS 2 installation + minimal test (Iron → Jazzy prep)
- Connect STM32 sensor via serial/UART
- Start YOLO + camera integration
- Enable VNC for GUI-less control (just in case)
