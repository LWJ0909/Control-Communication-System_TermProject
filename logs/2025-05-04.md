### 🎯 Goal  
Successfully boot Raspberry Pi 5 using Raspberry Pi OS and then Ubuntu 24.04.2 Desktop.  
Verify HDMI output via capture card, and establish a full remote development environment via SSH and VS Code.

<!-- 오늘 목표: Raspberry Pi OS와 Ubuntu 부팅 성공, HDMI 출력 확인, VSCode 원격개발환경 구축 -->

---

## 🔁 Summary of the Day  
Initial test with Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit) confirmed that the Pi hardware, SD card, and display connection were functioning properly.  
Following this, Ubuntu 24.04.2 Desktop was flashed onto a 32GB SD card, and successfully booted with HDMI output confirmed via capture device.  
SSH access was configured and verified.  
Remote development was set up using Visual Studio Code + Remote SSH.  
Python virtual environment and pip installation were tested under Ubuntu's new Python 3.12 restrictions.

## 🛠️ Work Log

### ✅ 1. Boot Test with Raspberry Pi OS (라즈비안)
- Used Raspberry Pi Imager to flash Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)
- Booted successfully on Pi 5
- Verified HDMI output via capture card (`ffplay /dev/video0`)
- Confirmed display, power, and SD card were not faulty

---

### ✅ 2. Ubuntu 24.04.2 Setup
- Flashed Ubuntu 24.04.2 Desktop (64-bit) onto a 32GB SD card
- HDMI capture device showed full boot sequence and desktop login
- Successfully logged into Ubuntu GUI

---

### ✅ 3. Initial System Setup
- User account: `wj`, locale and time zone configured
- Wi-Fi connection established
- Checked IP via `ifconfig` → `192.168.35.111`
- Confirmed HDMI was connected to HDMI0

---

### ✅ 4. SSH Remote Access
- From PC:  
  ```bash
  ssh wj@192.168.35.111
  ```
- SSH connection successful, verified via `uname -a`
- Pi was responsive even without direct monitor

---

### ✅ 5. VS Code Remote SSH Integration
- Installed `Remote - SSH` extension in VS Code
- Connected using `wj@192.168.35.111`
- VS Code Server installed automatically on Pi
- Remote terminal and file system available inside VS Code

---

### ✅ 6. Python Virtual Environment & pip
- `python3` present, but `python` not aliased
- Attempt to create venv failed initially:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv env  # failed due to missing ensurepip
  ```
- Fixed with:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install python3-venv python3-pip
  ```

- Pip install triggered Python 3.12 protection:
  ```bash
  error: externally-managed-environment
  ```
- Solved with:
  ```bash
  pip install --break-system-packages somepackage
  ```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| HDMI output missing | Confirmed working via capture card and HDMI0 |
| `python` not found | Used `python3` or installed `python-is-python3` |
| venv creation failed | Installed `python3-venv` |
| pip restricted by Python 3.12 policy | Used `--break-system-packages` flag |
| VS Code couldn't connect | Fixed after installing `Remote - SSH` extension |

---

## ✅ Final Outcome
- Raspberry Pi OS boot success confirmed baseline functionality
- Ubuntu 24.04.2 Desktop booted successfully on 32GB SD card
- HDMI output verified using USB capture card + ffplay
- SSH + VS Code remote development fully operational
- Python virtual environment ready for ROS and testing

---

## 🚀 Next Goals
- Test GPIO devices: camera module, LED, and buzzer
- Start installing ROS 2 Iron and set up environment
- Optional: Configure VNC for GUI remote access

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- Never trust an SD card just because it “works on PC”
- Capture cards are essential for headless Pi debugging
- Ubuntu with Python 3.12 introduces pip restrictions — know how to bypass safely
- VS Code Remote SSH drastically improves productivity for Pi development
